[B]External Providers:[/B]
By default, OneMoar only includes the ability to scrape your Debrid Service cloud for your personal files.

These internal scrapers are intended to be used for searching and playing back your personal content you have purchased or saved. OneMoar does not host any content.

If you wish to use an external scraper package with OneMoar, you must install that package then set that package as your External Provider. 

External Providers can be enabled in Tools> Providers > Enable External Providers.
External Providers can be set in Tools> Providers > External Provider

If you already have an external provider installed from a previous setup, 
the only action you will need to take would be to add the repo for that package 
to your kodi and set that provider in OneMoar Tools> Providers > External Provider

[B]***NOTICE***[/B]
External Providers are not intended to be used with OneMoar and therefore will not receive any support. 
OneMoar does not take responsibility for any results found using external providers.
Any issue opened for an external provider will immediately be closed and repeat instances will result in a ban from the OneMoar Github.
