## My personal taste of addons and repos to bring life to KODI.

Add this source in KODI's filemanager: https://stekpet.github.io/repository.dappes/
...or download [zip](repo/zips/repository.dappes/repository.dappes.0.0.3.zip) 

A private collection of my personal and modified go-to addons. Don't use it. If you do,it's at your own risk.

### Follow this excellent tutorial, template to make your own.
